### Corporate-app

Corporate-app is a React-based application aimed at improving employee productivity and motivation in a corporate setting. The main idea behind the app is to incentivize task completion and progression to higher levels by increasing the percentage of salary and rewarding employees with virtual coins, which can be exchanged for branded company merchandise or professional development courses. The app also aims to reduce administrative workload by centralizing all work-related tasks, provide access to a library of professional documentation, enforce etiquette and punctuality through penalty coins, facilitate communication through a work chat feature, and implement a rating system and testing capabilities to track employee performance and promote growth.

#### Key Features:

- Task and level management: Employees can create, track, and complete tasks, progressing through different levels and earning coins based on their achievements.
- Rewards and coin exchange: The app incorporates a reward system where employees can redeem coins for branded merchandise or professional development courses.
- Documentation library: A dedicated section within the app allows employees to access professional documentation relevant to their roles, enabling them to enhance their knowledge and skills.
- Penalty system: Penalties in the form of deducted coins are imposed for late submissions or violations of work etiquette.
- Work chat: The app provides a chat feature for seamless communication among employees within the corporate environment.
- Rating system and testing: Employees can earn access to new levels by completing tasks and successfully passing tests, encouraging continuous improvement and development.
- Integration with Poster system: The app integrates with the Poster system to gather data on coffee sales volume and average receipts, which are utilized to determine task rewards and coin distribution.

#### Project Status:

The Corporate-app project is currently under development and is being continuously enhanced and updated to meet the evolving needs of corporate environments and the feedback from users.
